        Hello and welcome! My name is Zachary, and I've been dabbling in various forms 
 	of software development for over 20 years, dating back to when I first got my 
  	hands on some of the early tools used for building custom websites and modding 
   	computer games as an infinitely curious kid with a Windows 98 PC in my bedroom.
    	
        Since then, I've maintained a growing personal passion and professional interest
      	in computer science. I'm still the same infinitely curious kid at heart, and I've
       	never resigned from the perpetual quest for knowledge. The more I learn, the more 
        I realize I've yet to discover, and I adhere to a student mindset through all of 
	life's myriad possibilities. Every day is a school day :)
       	
        I'm blessed to have had the privilege to explore a variety of career paths over 
	the past 16+ years in my ongoing pilgrimage of self-discovery, guided by an innate
	compass that has always pointed toward greater challenges than the last. My 
 	instincts are governed some intrinsic CI/CD algorithm, and I wouldn't want to 
  	chart my course through the subjective human experience by any other ruleset.
   
        As I've navigated the proverbial landscape of life through this scope, I've come 
    	to adopt certain core principles - the kernel truths of my existence - the deepest 
     	and most precious of life's unknown-unknowns. When compiled, these truths serve to 
      	formulate a genuine human identity; one by which I can experience life with 
       	confidence, security, and objective humility. To elucidate just a few:

        - Seek truth in all things - pragmatically, fearlessly, and relentlessly. 
 
        - Serve Anima as an agent of its will to cultivate, nurture, and perpertuate all 
  	of its components and processes, both physical and metaphysical.
   
        - Oppose Entropy defiantly, refusing to surrender to the forces that work to break
    	us down at every level until nothing of substantial value remains.
     
        - Pursue and promote fellowship, striving to establish common ground in the tense 
      	space between conscious minds. That common ground is where humanity grows.
      
        Through dedicated pursuit and discovery of these values, I'm enabled to engineer 
       	an inalienable and ever-evolving sense of purpose in life. Through unwavering 
        commitment to these values, I'm empowered to achieve an objective and holistic 
	sense of fulfillment in all of life's endeavors, regardless of their subjective 
 	outcomes. Through practical application of these values, I'm able to illuminate
  	my path with every step, in both prospect and retrospect. Through sharing these
   	values, there is hope that the light may serve as a beacon for those who feel
    	lost in the dark.
       
        Thank you for visiting, and I invite you to also check out the profile page for
        my personal brand, Secret Fire Creative: https://github.com/secretfirecreative
